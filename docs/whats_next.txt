# this is just a little reminder where I left of the last time


remove max/maya and official/nightly bullshit
rather add separation between vray2 and vray3

"Transport endpoint is not connected" must be handled as an error in afanasy

vpn to fritzbox ? puh!

setup video!

store config.json in root folder - put to .gitignore

remove official and nightlies....makes no sense!!! 

aws deployment/provisioning scripts! maybe checkout open-source tools to do that!

convert scene_data_list to and ocrScene Object!!!
	after that: add "by frame" to tableView 
update logging
